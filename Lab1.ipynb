        "Task:\n",
        "* Your task is to create a Python Class (`ArrayFuncs`) that contains methods to perform the following operations:\n",
        " * Elementwise Multiplication (`ele_mult(a,b)`) of N x 1 arrays\n",
        " * Inner Product of  N x 1 arrays (`inner_prod(a,b)`)  \n",
        " * Outer Product of N x 1 arrays (`outer_prod(a,b)`)\n",
        " * Matrix multiplucation of N x M matrices (`mat_mult(a,b)`)\n",
        "\n",
        " Note: Don't use the numpy inbuilt inner/outer functions, you must use matrix mutliplication to perform these operations\n",
        "\n",
        " Note 2: You do not need to include exception handling (this functionality will not be tested on submission).       \n",
        "\n",
        " Note 3: In this notebook we import Numpy as np, this means all the NumPy methods will be implemented as `np.method`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning Outcomes:\n",
        "* In this lab you will gain experience of constructing a python class with several methods, instantiating the class and testing your methods.\n",
        "* You will learn basic numpy operations including creating arrays/matrices and the difference between elementwise and matrix multiplication.\n",

        "> As we can see in the image below, we can create arrays in numpy of 1,2,3 (or even greater) dimensions. It is important to note that the 1D array is more properly called a vector, it is not explicit that it represents a row or column. In practice instead of vectors we use arrays of size N x 1 (N can be 2,3,4..), so these arrays can use use numpy functions such as matrix multiplication (and follow the rules of matrix multiplication). For example we can create a 3 x 1 array using np.array([[1],[2],[3]])\n",

        "\n",
        ">  In elementwise multiplication if the two arrays are the same size, then each element of the arrays multiplies the corresponding element of the 2nd arrays. If the arrays have at least one equal dimension and the other dimensions are 1 then the NumPy broadcasting rule applies. You can read more about [broadcasting in NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html) here. In this case here where we multiply the 1 x 3 array by the 3 x 3 array, the elements of the 1 x 3 array can be broadcast along the rows of the 3 x 3 array. It is important to note the differnce between elementwise multiplication and traditional matrix multiplication.\n",

(In linear (matrix) algebra the typical convention is that vectors represent n-rows and 1 column, so the transpose will be 1 row and n-columns).
